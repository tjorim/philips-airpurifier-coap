Add the following to your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
philips_airpurifier_coap:
  host: 192.168.0.17
  model: ac4236
```

*adapt the `host` according to your setup*

### Multiple devices

Add the following to your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
philips_airpurifier_coap:
  - host: 192.168.0.100
    model: ac1214

  - host: 192.168.0.101
    model: ac1214

  - host: 192.168.0.102
    model: ac1214
```

*adapt the `host` according to your setup*


## Configuration variables:

## Is your model not supported yet?

You can help to get us there.

Please open an issue and provide the raw status-data for each combination of modes and speeds for your model.

To aquire those information please follow these steps:

### Prepare the environment

```sh
git clone https://github.com/betaboon/philips-airpurifier.git
cd philips-airpurifier
source aioairctrl-shell.sh
```

### Aquire raw status-data

- run the following command to aquire the raw data (still in the venv)

```sh
aioairctrl --host $DEVICE_IP status --json
```

## Debugging:

To aquire debug-logs, add the following to your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
logger:
  logs:
    custom_components.philips_airpurifier_coap: debug
    coap: debug
    aioairctrl: debug
```

logs should now be available in `home-assistant.log`


## Usage:

The integration provides `fan` entities for your devices which are [documented here](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/fan/).
